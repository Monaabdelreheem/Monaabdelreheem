# 👋 Hi, I'm Mona Abdelreheem

I'm an aspiring software engineer with a focus on front-end web development. My background in education has shaped my communication, problem-solving, and empathy skills — all of which I bring into every line of code I write.

Currently enrolled in the TripleTen Software Engineering Bootcamp, I'm building responsive, accessible, and user-centered applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. I'm passionate about creating tools that support families, education, and mental wellness.
